## Open Health AI ðŸš€

### Overview
Open Health AI is a comprehensive data pipeline and machine learning framework designed for healthcare applications. This project integrates real-time data ingestion, transformation, storage, model training, visualization, and continuous model improvement to provide predictive analytics and insights in healthcare.

### Architecture
The project follows a structured pipeline with six key phases:

#### PHASE 1: Data Collection and Ingestion
Collects data from multiple sources, including clinical sessions, wearable devices, and self-reported patient data.
Uses Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming into the system.

#### PHASE 2: ETL and Storage
Data transformation, cleaning, and enrichment handled by Apache Airflow.
Transformed data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

#### PHASE 3: Data Preprocessing and Model Training
Feature extraction and normalization for machine learning.
Model training for predictive analytics (e.g., mental health prediction) using Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or Keras.

#### PHASE 4: API and Security Compliance
Exposes API endpoints using Flask to allow external applications to interact with the data and trained models.
Security compliance verification using HashiCorp Vault to ensure encrypted data storage and secure access.

#### PHASE 5: Visualization and Monitoring
Generates interactive dashboards for data insights, model performance, and compliance tracking using Tableau and Streamlit.
Monitors Kafka topics, API usage, and model performance in real time.

#### PHASE 6: Continuous Model Improvement
Feedback collection from clinicians and patients to refine and improve models.
Uses the ETL and model training pipelines to retrain models continuously.
Marks the completion of a full cycle, ready for restarting to enhance system accuracy.
